# Guessing Game in NodeJS
Number guessing game created just to test NodeJS for the first time.

Testing:
- Open up your command line, cd into the same directory as the input_and_output.js file and with NodeJS on your machine type in: "node input_and_output.js".
- It's gonna ask you to think of a random number between 0 and 100
- Then you can enjoy endless hours of guessing game with the machine, have fun! :)
